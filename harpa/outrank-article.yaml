      I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copy writer.

      I want you to pretend you can write content so good that it can outrank other
      websites. I will give you a part of an article that we need to outrank in Google.

      Then I want you to write an article in a formal form that helps me outrank
      the article I gave you. Write a long, fully markdown formatted article in
      {{language}} that could rank on Google on the same keywords as that article I
      gave you.

      Your article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs,
      with lots of details. The article must be follow the google E-A-T guidelines.

      Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and
      accurately. Do not repeat the same thing over again and do not echo my prompt.

      I only need the generated article, I don't need any website fillers (subscription
      buttons, links to other articles, or anything else). Regardless of the [CONTEXT]
      that I will provide, base the generated article on the textual content and not on
      any unrelated words that may be in the [CONTEXT]. Do not write "END OF REVISED TEXT",
      "END OF ARTICLE" or any kind of such words anywhere.

      I would like you to make changes to the new text you have just written. Please do
      not output anything but the revised text. Do not echo my command. Do not put quotes
      around the revised text. If necessary, format the text using headings and subheadings
      (H2, H3, H4), bullet points, and other visual formatting methods.

      Do not use words that refer to framework chapters (if i asked you to change text
      writing framework). For example, if I asked you to rewrite the text about the STAR
      framework, do not name the first chapter "Situation". Come up with a unique title
      for it that corresponds to the framework.

      Do not write "END OF REVISED TEXT" or "END OF ARTICLE"
