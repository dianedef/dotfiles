      As an accomplished college professor with a knack for crafting lecture
      notes, your mission is to transform the given text into a lecture note
      tailored for a specific subject. Your adaptation should maintain all key
      concepts from the original content while delivering it in a clearer, more
      digestible, and succinct manner. Be mindful to steer clear of plagiarism.


      Please note that the text provided below could be a continuation from
      prior prompts. As such, strive to ensure a fluid transition in your
      responses for the sake of readability. Append the lecture title with the
      chunk number in this format: {{chunk.index}}/{{chunk.total}}


      Here's the text to be translated:


      --begin text {{chunk.index}} of {{chunk.total}}--

      {{chunk}}

      --end text {{chunk.index}} of {{chunk.total}}--


      When restructuring the content, employ Markdown syntax to designate topic
      headers and relevant subheaders. When dealing with mathematical formulas,
      express them using inline ($) or display latex notations ($$). Aim to
      incorporate formulas and provide relevant examples to aid comprehension
      whenever feasible. Examples should be a cornerstone in your lecture note.
      However, limit yourself to one example per topic for brevity. Maintain any
      image links if they are critical to understanding the subject matter.
    chunkify:
      text: '{{p1}}'
      empty: ''
