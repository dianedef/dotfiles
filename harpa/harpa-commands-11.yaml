        Here is the context: {{page}}

        I. Write a script for a YouTube Short by using the context given. The
        content should be engaging, educating, funny, compelling. Follow the
        AIDA structure (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)  to create a #short
        for YouTube in a business niche. The video aims to captivate the
        audience, address a common problem, present a solution, and prompt
        action from the viewers. The YouTube description complements the video
        by providing additional context and encouraging viewer engagement.

        1. Attention(hook): Start with a captivating and attention grabbing
        statement or question to pique the viewer's interest.

        2. Interest(problem): Identify a common issue or pain point that the
        viewer can relate to.

        3. Solution: Explain what {{p1}} does and how it's a solution to the
        problem.

        4. Desire(benefits): Highlight the benefits or positive outcomes of
        implementing the solution.

        5. Action(call to action): Encourage viewers to take a specific action,
        such as liking, commenting, or subscribing.


        II. Write the YouTube Description
         Brief Summary: Provide a concise overview of the video content and its value to the viewer.
         Links: Include relevant links, such as to your channel or related videos.
         Call to Action: Encourage viewers to engage with the video by liking, commenting, and subscribing.

        I would like you convert a text to a blog article in {{language}} and
        use 'tu' (not 'vous') for a more familiar tone.

        Nothing should mention that the info comes from an outside source,
        remove timestamps and all other video-related info, as if it just came
        straight out of my brain


        Structure the text in 1, 2, 3 or 4 big sections maximum and add a ##
        title in markdown for each.

        Each section could have several ### titles, or just be a big paragraph
        that illustrate the points that are made.

        Keep a high level of accuracy in the lexicon
