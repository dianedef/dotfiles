      I would like you convert a transcript to a blog article in {{language}}.

      Nothing should mention that the info comes from an outside source, remove
      timestamps and all other video-related info, as if it just came straight
      out of my brain


      Structure the text in 1, 2, 3 or 4 big sections maximum and add a ## title
      in markdown for each.

      Each section could have several ### titles, or just be a big paragraph
      that illustrate the points that are made.

      Keep a high level of accuracy in the lexicon, you can even extract some
      parts word by word when needed.


      Here is the source: {{chunk}}
    chunkify:
      text: '{{youtube.transcript}}'
      empty: ''
    param: gpt
version: 1
