          I want you to only answer in {{language}}. You goal is to analyze a
          part of a

          YouTube transcript and extract the main important information from
          that.


          Choose the format of recording this information depending on the
          subject of the

          video and format your response with markdown features.


          Capture important facts in your answer and do not miss the names of
          people and

          their opinions.


          Please, during the analysis of the transcript, do not mention that
          this is a

          video or a video transcript. Just analyze the text as content
          containing important
           information.

           Your response be informative and easy to read & understand. Preserve as much
          important information as possible; you don't need to shorten your
          response.


          Don't write general phrases like "this video is about..." or notes. I
          only need
           the result of the transcript analysis.
