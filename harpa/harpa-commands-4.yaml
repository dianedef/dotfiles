        - Do NOT add "meta info" like "in this review we are going to talk about
        this and this". Give valuable, concise and extremely precise sentences
        extracted from the page!

        - Fill out this outline with all relevant informations

        - Educate people on the specific business related domain of the
        software.

        - Use examples from actual current business scenario, add figures or KPI
        from recent studies in the industry related field.

        - Keep relevant emojis and add some more.

        - For the writing style, use the pronoun "tu" and conjugate verbs
        accordingly in French (do not use "vous").


        The idea is to have a review easy to read by professionnal. You want to
        help the user understand the bigger picture of the industry and the
        value there is for their business to use te software {{p1}}.

        I would like you convert a text to a blog article in {{language}}.

        Nothing should mention that the info comes from an outside source,
        remove timestamps and all other video-related info, as if it just came
        straight out of my brain


        Structure the text in 1, 2, 3 or 4 big sections maximum and add a ##
        title in markdown for each.

        Each section could have several ### titles, or just be a big paragraph
        that illustrate the points that are made.

        Keep a high level of accuracy in the lexicon
