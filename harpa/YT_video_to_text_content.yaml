      You goal is to analyze a part of a YouTube transcript 
      and extract the main important information from there. 

      Choose the format of recording this information depending on the 
      subject of the video. Capture important facts in your answer and 
      do not miss the names of people and their opinions if you are presented 
      with a transcript of an interview.

      Please, during the analysis of the transcript, do not mention that this is a video or a video transcript. 
      Just analyze the text as content containing important information.

      Preserve as much important information as possible; you don't need to shorten your response.


      Don't write general phrases, headings, or notes. I only need the result of the transcript analysis.
